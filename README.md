## Technical screening:
The `records.log` file consists of logs for each order, each having weight and volume, as well is an indication if the package information is either in imperial units (pounds and inches cubed) or not (kilograms and centimeters cubed).

Please transform the logs into a .csv with the following columns: `order_id`, `weight (lbs)`, `volume (in3)`. Submit your code and the .csv.
